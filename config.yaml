# Simplified Configuration - Single Unified Loss Objective
# Philosophy: ONE reconstruction loss (like SRDRN) + KL regularization
# Avoids multi-objective trade-offs!

  # Intensity weighting - TUNED to reduce over-emphasis on extremes

  w_max: 3.0          # Allow stronger extreme emphasis

  # Extra boost for extreme tail (P99+)
  # Reduced from 2.0 to prevent over-focus on extremes that hurts spatial coherence
