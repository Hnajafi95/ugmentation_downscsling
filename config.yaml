# Simplified Configuration - Single Unified Loss Objective
# Philosophy: ONE reconstruction loss (like SRDRN) + KL regularization
# Avoids multi-objective trade-offs!

  # Intensity weighting - OPTIMIZED based on data analysis
  # P90 = 11.7 mm/day, P95 = 20.1 mm/day, P99 = 43.6 mm/day
  # Using P95 as scale (not P90 which was too aggressive)
  scale: 20.0         # Based on P95 percentile - moderate emphasis
  w_min: 0.1          # Min weight for light rain
  w_max: 3.0          # Allow stronger extreme emphasis

  # Extra boost for extreme tail (P99+)
  # With scale=20, P99 gets base weight=2.18, with tail_boost=2.0 → effective=4.36 (44x vs light)
  tail_boost: 2.0     # Strong emphasis on P99+ extremes
