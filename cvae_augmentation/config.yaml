# Phase 1 Low-Risk Fixes - Critical Bug Fixes + Conditioning Dropout
# Philosophy: ONE reconstruction loss (like SRDRN) + KL regularization
#
# CRITICAL FIXES:
#   1. w_min=1.0 (was 0.1): Stop ignoring dry region errors → fixes drizzle everywhere
#   2. Conditioning dropout (p=0.5): Force decoder to use z → fixes posterior collapse
#   3. beta_kl=0.0005 (was 0.005): Allow latent usage → fixes diversity
#   4. Transposed convolutions: Learnable upsampling → better spatial structure
