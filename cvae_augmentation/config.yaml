  # High-res encoder
  d_y: 256               # Dimension of h_Y embedding
  in_channels_Y: 1       # Number of channels in Y_hr (precipitation only)

  # Static channels (automatically determined from statics config)

# Loss function weights
loss:

  beta_kl: 0.5           # Final weight for KL divergence
  warmup_epochs: 30      # Number of epochs for KL warm-up (0 → beta_kl) - increased from 10
  min_kl_weight: 0.5     # Minimum KL per latent dim (free bits) - prevents collapse to zero

# Training configuration

  weight_decay: 0.0001   # Weight decay for AdamW optimizer

  amp: true              # Use automatic mixed precision (AMP)
  save_every: 5          # Save checkpoint every N epochs
  early_stopping_patience: 30  # Stop if no improvement for N epochs (increased from 15)

# Learning rate scheduler
scheduler:
  type: "cosine"         # "cosine", "plateau", or "step"
  T_max: 80              # For cosine: max epochs

  gamma: 0.5             # For step: gamma

# Validation and logging
validation:
  val_every: 1           # Validate every N epochs

# Sampling configuration (for sample_cvae.py)
sampling:
  mode: "posterior"      # "posterior" or "prior"
  K: 2                   # Number of samples per day
  days: "heavy_only"     # "heavy_only", "file:path/to/list.txt", "split:val", "split:train"
  min_threshold: 0.1     # Minimum mass threshold (fraction of real day's mass)
